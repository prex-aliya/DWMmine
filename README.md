DWM - a suckless window manager
===============================

__Now without Status Bar__

![DWM](./.img/dwm.png)

This is my every day use case, dwm customization.
Mine comes with out a status bar, because I have the most
suckless status bar off all, a clock.

# Uniqueness

- Three levels of 9 workspaces
        * For used when both hands are on keyboard
- No status bar
        * For the most suckless thing, a clock.
- Cropwindows
        * Mod-Shift-Space to revert back
        * Mod-Shift-RigtMouse to move in crop
        * Mod-Shift-LeftMouse to crop at cursor
- Fake fullscreen
        * fullscreening a video stays within its window
        * Only allow clients to "fullscreen" into space currently given to them.
